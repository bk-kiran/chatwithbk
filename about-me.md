# About Me

## Who I Am

I'm Kiran Balasundaram Kuppuraj, a Computer Science student at UMass Amherst (Class of 2027) with a passion for building practical, scalable software that solves real-world problems. I maintain a 3.82 GPA while actively engaging in software development, teaching, and research across multiple domains.

## What Drives Me

I'm fascinated by the intersection of AI/ML and full-stack engineering. I love taking complex problems—whether it's predicting demand for thousands of products, coordinating disaster relief volunteers, or helping students optimize their resumes—and building end-to-end solutions that genuinely help people. My approach combines strong technical fundamentals with a bias toward shipping: I believe the best code is code that's deployed and making an impact.

## My Technical Journey

I've worked across the entire stack, from building distributed messaging systems handling 2K+ concurrent users at Zyntra.io, to developing machine learning pipelines for healthcare analytics at TruBridge, to deploying demand forecasting models that saved $20K annually at LeeYuen Housewares. I'm comfortable whether I'm writing Python data pipelines, architecting React frontends, optimizing database queries, or deploying Dockerized microservices to AWS.

**My go-to stack:** React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Express or FastAPI for backend, PostgreSQL/MongoDB for databases, and AWS for cloud infrastructure. I'm also deeply interested in AI—I regularly integrate Claude and OpenAI APIs into my projects and have research experience in BioNLP/ML.

## Beyond the Code

At UMass, I'm deeply involved in the tech community through multiple organizations:

**BUILD UMass** - As both a Software Developer and Treasurer, I help lead one of UMass's premier software development clubs. I manage our finances, coordinate project teams, and contribute to building real products for clients. BUILD has taught me how to balance technical leadership with organizational responsibility.

**Google Developer Student Club (GDSC)** - Being part of GDSC connects me to a global network of student developers. I participate in workshops, hackathons, and collaborative projects that keep me at the cutting edge of Google technologies and industry best practices.

**iCons (Integrated Concentration in Science)** - Through iCons, I explore the intersection of technology with real-world challenges across disciplines. This program has shaped how I think about building technology that serves broader societal needs, not just technical elegance.

I'm also a Software Engineer at **PartyPilot** (an AI startup on campus) and a Teaching Assistant for Intro to Python and Computer Systems. I love helping others learn—whether that's debugging a student's code in office hours or mentoring teammates through their first Docker deployment.

I believe in building with purpose. My Kapok project for disaster relief coordination has helped 200+ volunteers manage relief operations across 10+ disaster zones. My AI Resume Analyzer has helped students pass ATS screens and land interviews. These aren't just portfolio pieces—they're tools people actually use.

## What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking opportunities where I can work on challenging technical problems with real impact. I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments where shipping quickly and iterating based on feedback is valued. Whether it's a startup building the next big platform, a company tackling complex data problems, or a team pushing the boundaries of AI applications—if you're building something meaningful, I want to be part of it.

## My Working Style

- **Ship first, polish later:** I believe in getting MVPs out fast and iterating based on real user feedback
- **Full ownership:** I take responsibility for features end-to-end, from database schema to frontend polish
- **Pragmatic problem solver:** I choose technologies based on the problem at hand, not hype
- **Continuous learner:** Currently exploring advanced AI/ML applications, distributed systems, and cloud-native architectures
- **Collaborative:** I thrive in code reviews, pair programming, and knowledge-sharing environments

## Fun Facts

- I've deployed systems used by 5K+ daily users across healthcare, manufacturing, and disaster relief
- I'm proficient in 8+ programming languages but believe the best language is the one that solves the problem
- I use Cursor and GitHub Copilot extensively—I believe AI tools make great developers even better
- I've optimized ETL pipelines, reduced scraping runtimes by 40%, and improved system uptime from 95% to 99%

## Let's Connect

I'm always excited to discuss interesting projects, technical challenges, or potential collaborations. Whether you want to chat about AI applications, debate the merits of different tech stacks, or explore working together—feel free to reach out!
